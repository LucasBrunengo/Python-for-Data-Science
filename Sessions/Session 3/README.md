# **Session 3** 

In Session 3, I explored object-oriented programming concepts in Python. This session focused on defining classes, managing attributes, and implementing methods. The exercises revolved around creating a simple course registration system that allows students to enroll in courses and manage their registrations.

## **List of exercises:** 

### **Exercise 1: Course Class**

         - Create a **Course** class, where each course has a name, a description and a list of enrolled students. You'll need to implement the next methods:
            - Add a student to the course.
            - Remove a student from the course.
            - Show all students in the course.

* Description: A class representing a course with methods to manage students enrolled in the course.

* Input:

   - Course details such as:
      - name: "Python Programming"
      - course_type: "Online"
      - Description: "Learn the fundamentals of Python programming."

### **Exercise 2: Student Class**

      - Create a **Student** class, where each student has a name, ID number, address and a list of enrolled courses with the following methods:
         - Enroll in a course.
         - Drop a course.
         - Show all registered student courses.

* Description: A class representing a student with methods to show student information.

* Input:

   - Student details such as:
      - Name: "Lucas Brunengo"
      - ID: "LB0202"

### **Exercise 3: Registration Class**

      - Create a central class that manages courses and students, **Registration** class, where you have a list of students and a list of courses, and methods:
          - Enroll in a course.
          - Drop a course.
          - Show all the enrolled courses.
          - Show all the students.

* Description: A class representing a registration system for managing courses.

* Input:

![Course_Registration_Input](../../Screenshots/Session%203/Inputs/Session3_Ex3_Inp4.png)

   - Course object to add to the registration system.

* Output:

### **Exercise 4: Calculate GPA (Extended)**

      - Let's add grades to each student's course and create method that yields the GPA given a student name or ID.

* Description: A method added to the Course class that calculates the average GPA of enrolled students.

* Input:
