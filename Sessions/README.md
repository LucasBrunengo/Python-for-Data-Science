## Files Overview

- **Session 1**: 
  - This session introduces basic Python concepts, including printing output, performing arithmetic operations, string manipulation, working with lists, dictionaries, tuples, sets, conditional statements, loops, and functions. Exercises include creating a simple calculator and calculating the average of student grades.

- **Session 2**: 
  - In this session, we focus on functions and data filtering. Exercises include creating a FizzBuzz function, filtering mixed data types from a list, managing a simple to-do list with task addition and display functions, and converting temperatures from Celsius to Fahrenheit.

- **Session 3**: 
  - This session delves into more advanced topics such as file handling, error management, and object-oriented programming (OOP). Exercises cover reading from and writing to files, handling exceptions gracefully, and designing classes to encapsulate data and behavior.
